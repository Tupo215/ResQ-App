# ResQ-App
This is the Backend for the ResQ Application.

ResQMission operates within the digital health, emergency response, and mobility sectors. It seeks to leverage existing transportation networks, healthcare providers, and artificial intelligence to improve response time, coordination, and access to care for road accident victims. By addressing delays, poor communication, and lack of coordination, the platform supports Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and responds to a critical need in the African urban context.
